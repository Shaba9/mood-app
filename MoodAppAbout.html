        <h4>Inspiration:</h4>
        <p>
            Now that you’re sold on the <a href="MoodApp.html">MoodApp</a>, let’s talk a little about the inspiration behind the app.
             After a couple of decades on this planet, the creator behind the app grew weary of the
             irrationality of people’s actions. After some serious speculation, it was deemed that
             this was perhaps due to the lack of touch between a person and his/her/their true emotions.
             Thus, the <a href="MoodApp.html">MoodApp</a> was created!

        </p>
